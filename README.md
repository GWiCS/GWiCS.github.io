### Hacktoberfest

If you are new and not sure how to contribute here are the steps: 
1. If an existing issue already exists, make sure to comment that you will be doing it (avoid overlap of work!)
2. `fork` this repository (Basically copying it as a repo of your own that you can edit!)
3. `clone` the repository that you have forked (using `git clone [URL]`)
4. make all the changes you want! 
5. push the changes onto your forked repo (using `git add <file>` -> `git commit -m "commit message"` -> `git push`)
6. create a Pull request against this repo and wait for review! 
ðŸŽ‰ woo one down, 4 to go!
